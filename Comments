Comments are not executed as part of the code, it used to explain things that might be hard to understand.
Use comments only when there is a need to explain things.
Don't use comments too much.

Two types of comments are supported in PHP:
1- Single-line comment supported by two ways, using // c++ style or using # shell-style:
2- Multi-line comment by using /* at the start of the comment and */ at the end of the comment.

Example:

<?php
// This is a single-line comment using c++ style
# This is  a single-line comment using shell-style
/*
This code won't run 
echo "Hi";
*/
