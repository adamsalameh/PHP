Comments are not executed as part of the code, it used to explain things that might be hard to understand.
Use comments only when there is a need to explain things.
Don't use too much comments.

There is three ways to write comments in PHP:
// this is a single-line comment
# this is another way to write a single-line comment
/* This is a way to write
multiple-line  
comment */

Example:

<?php
// This is a comment so the code won't run here $x;

# This is another comment 

/*
This code won't run 
echo "Hi";

*/
